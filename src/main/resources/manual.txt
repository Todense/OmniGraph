1. Basic mouse controls

- Zoom in\out: mouse scroll
- Add node: left click on background
- Add edge: right click on first node and drag mouse to second node
- Remove node/edge: middle click on node/edge or open context menu -> delete
- Open node/edge context menu: right click on node/edge
- Select nodes: right click on canvas and drag mouse to create selection area
- Select/deselect node/edge: CTRL + left click on node/edge

2. Keyboard shortcuts

CTRL + DEL - delete graph
CTRL + Q - adjust camera to graph
CTRL + R - create random graph
CTRL + L - start graph layout
CTRL + P - create path 
CTRL + K - add all edges


3. Algorithms

Default start and goal nodes are the first and the last node of a graph. Start and goal nodes can be set in node context menu.

There are two weight function options for algorithms with weighted edges:
a) length - weight of an edge is set to its length (used when edge weight option in graph appearance menu is set to 'None' or 'Distance')
b) custom - weight of an edge is set to its custom weight specified by user (used when edge weight option in graph appearance menu is set to 'Custom')
