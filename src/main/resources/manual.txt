3. Algorithms

Default start and goal nodes are the first and the last node of a graph. Start and goal nodes can be set in node context menu.

There are two weight function options for algorithms with weighted edges:
a) length - weight of an edge is set to its length (used when edge weight option in graph appearance menu is set to 'None' or 'Distance')
b) custom - weight of an edge is set to its custom weight specified by user (used when edge weight option in graph appearance menu is set to 'Custom')
